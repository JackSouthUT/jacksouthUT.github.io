<b><h1 style="text-align:center;font-family:signpainter;font-style:bold;&gt; align=" center"=""> ABOUT ME </h1>
<p style="text-align:center;font-family:heiti sc;font-size:16px;font-style:italic"> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;I am a first-year student at the University of Texas at Austin majoring in Corporate Finance and hoping to pick up a minor at a later date! I was born and raised in Austin, TX, only a few miles from campus. I am from a family of 5, including myself, my two older sisters, and my parents. I love animals as my parents used to own a pet store and have helped to raise or rehabilitate many different types of animals, including balled pythons, chinchillas, ferrets, monkeys, coatimundis, and many more. </p>

<p style="text-align:center;font-family:heiti sc;font-size:16px;font-style:italic"> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of my favorite activities are hiking, swimming, hanging out at the beach, playing sand-volleyball, and tennis. My favorite TV show is Community, though some honorable mentions go out to The Office and Pair of Kings (best show of my childhood). As an Austin Native, my favorite places in Austin so far are Barton Springs, Zilker Park, and the Hill of Life on the Greenbelt trail.  </p>
